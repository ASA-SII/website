Big Tent for Statistics. It is the second-oldest, continuously operating professional association in the country. 
Since it was founded in Boston in 1839, the ASA has supported excellence in the development, application, and dissemination of 
statistical science through Meetings, Member Services, Education, Publications, Advocacy, and Accreditation.
